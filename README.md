# Linux Cheatsheets

A personal collection of Linux cheatsheets — simple, fast references for everyday terminal work.  
Each file is grouped by topic for quick lookup.

## 📂 Contents
- **arch.txt** – Arch Linux notes and pacman commands  
- **cli.txt** – General command-line usage and file management  
- **git.txt** – Git basics and common workflows  
- **i3.txt** – i3 window manager commands and configs  
- **misc.txt** – Assorted tips and utilities  
- **neovim.txt** – Neovim commands, shortcuts, and setup notes  

## 💡 Purpose
These are **practical reminders**, not tutorials.  
They’re built from daily use, kept short, and rely on muscle memory — not hand-holding.  

## ⚙️ Usage
Clone the repo to keep them handy offline:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/linux-cheatsheets.git ~/cheatsheets
